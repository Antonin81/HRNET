# HRnet

## What is HRnet ?

HRnet is a project coded for my OpenClassrooms studies. Its objectives are :

-   to translate the app in React.
-   to transform jquery packages into React components.
-   to take one jquery package and turn it into a React package.

I used TypeScript as well in the whole project.\

The [jquery version](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end) is given at the start of the project.\

This project is a small app to register all the employees in a company.

## How it looks

## How to work on it

This project uses React, Typescript, Sass, npm, Eslint and Prettier \
To work on it, fork the project.\
Here are the executable commands :

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser, or on the port you changed if you did.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

Runs the linter.

### `npm run preview`

Runs the built version on [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).

### `npm run sass`

Compiles in real time your scss files in a css file.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
